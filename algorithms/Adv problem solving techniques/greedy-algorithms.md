-   Optimization algos → choices at every step

Q) What is Greedy algorithm? $\\$
_Greedy algorithm:_ This algo chooses the best possible choice at the given moment.

Greedy algos → focuses on _local optimization_ i.e. every step is optimized in the hope that the final series of steps is optimized.

Q) when to apply Greedy approach?
