## Introduction to Data science
Some useful points about python:
* General purpose language
* Has a specific ecosystem for data science known as **SciPy**
* The SciPy stack contains libraries like pandas and matplotlib
* Pandas &rarr; data querying and manipulating of data
   - Pandas uses relation theory similar to DBMS
* Matplotlib &rarr; plotting using data

Q) What do you think of data science?
Ans) Basically study of data and various aspects of data.

Q) Why is there a lot of demand for data scientist?
Ans) It is basic to create any product we need data about the interests of customers, their needs / requirements etc. So to better understand this data, how to interpret this data we need data scientist.

Data science Consists of:
* Hacking skills
* Math and statistics knowledge
* Substantive expertise
* Skepticism
* experimentation, simulation and replication

A data scientist should be able to convey communicate the their findings that can include graphs, charts etc.

Data science can be summed up as (quoted by Donoho)
* Exploration and preparation of data (extracting and cleaning of data)
* Structuring, representing and transforming data (i.e. converting it into useful stuff)
* Computing the data from previous stages
* Data modeling &rarr; predictive, generative modeling
* Data visualization and presentation &rarr; using graphs, charts, 3d models to visualize the results
* Science in data science &rarr; exploring/discovering different techniques and methods that work for data science.

Data science kinda marries statistics and machine learning together.
