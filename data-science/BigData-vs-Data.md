In this we will try to understand the difference between big data and normal data you tend to use.

Big data is of course data you can think of it as big daddy of normal data we work with.

So data is some sort of information which are qualitative and quantitative variables can have many forms, like digital / analog, structured and unstructured, machine readable (binary) or not etc.

**Data on its own is pretty much meaningless unless we are able to draw conclusions and interpret it.**

This data is used to gain knowledge and wisdom and generate some sort of insights (processing)

Whats so special about big data and why would you need different applications or methods to handle big data?

Ans) The speciality of big data is that it has additionaly properties that differentiate it from normal data which are known as 3 V's:
* Volume &rarr; It refers to the size / amount of data produced
* Velocity &rarr; It refere to the rate of data produced
* Variety &rarr; &rarr; It refers to evolution / change in data produced

Here big doesn't only stress on more volume but even the rate of data produced and constant change in data that **traditional** methods and softwares are unable to cope up.
