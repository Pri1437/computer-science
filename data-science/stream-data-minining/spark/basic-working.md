## Introduction
Spark is an **open-source, distributed processing system** used for large data processing.

Spark is generally used for big data workloads. Spark in simple terms it's fast and general engine for large-scale data processing

Reasons for fast and general purpose:
* Spark is faster than other approaches like classical **MapReduce** as spark runs in RAM rather than on disk drive.
* Spark can be used for any data processing like running distributed SQL, using machine learning algorithms, capturing data from database, and even for capturing data streams, graphs etc.

## Spark streaming
Until now we have used spark for mainly streaming purpose
